== Terms and definitions


Data Cube:: In computer programming contexts, a data cube (or datacube) is a multi-dimensional ("n-D") array of values. Typically, the term data cube is applied in contexts where these arrays are massively larger than the hosting computer's main memory; examples include multi-terabyte/petabyte data warehouses and time series of image data. 
FAIR Climate Service:: Climate resilience information system where the entire architecture is following FAIR principles.
FAIR principle:: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets.
Resilience:: Ability of a system to compensate impacts.
Sentinel (satellite mission):: A series of next-generation Earth observation missions developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), on behalf of the joint ESA/European Commission initiative Copernicus.
