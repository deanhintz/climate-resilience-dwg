== Use cases [[Chapter_Use_Cases]]

In a pilot study on interoperability, a use case represents a specific scenario or application that demonstrates how different components, such as data, models, and systems, interact and exchange information to address a particular challenge or problem. In the context of droughts and fires, use cases showcase how interoperability enables seamless integration and analysis of diverse geospatial data sources, coupled with specialized models, to enhance understanding, prediction, and mitigation of drought and fire risks. These use cases provide practical demonstrations of how interoperability workflows and techniques can be applied to foster effective collaboration, decision-making, and climate resilience in the face of drought and fire-related challenges.

=== Drought Impact Use Cases

Based on the ARD, drought indicator, and data cube components, WHU developed three use-cases based on a self-developed Open Geospatial Engine (OGE) for drought impact for rapid response to drought occurrences. <<DroughtWildfire>> shows the technical architecture of the OGE. It has the following features: 1) For data discovery, a catalog service from the OGE data center following OGC API is provided, allowing users to search geospatial data both available from WHU data stores and remote data stores; 2) For data integration, data can be integrated into the WHU software in the form of data cubes with three efforts: formalizing cube dimensions for multi-source geospatial data, processing geospatial data query along cube dimensions, and organizing cube data for high-performance geoprocessing; 3) For data processing, a processing chain is enabled in OGE using a code editor and model builder; and 4) For data visualization, a Web-based client for visualization of spatial data and statistics is provided using a virtual globe and charts.

==== Case study 1: Visualization for drought indicator

A drought risk map on a virtual globe, incorporating SPEI and OGE, was created as shown in <<WHU_image7>> (a). The color matching of the visualization result is referenced to the classification standard for the drought grade of SPEI illustrated in the table. The red and orange area in the visualization result represents a trend of drought (SPEI≤-0.5), while the green and blue represent wetness. The SPEI is calculated for each month of the input dataset and users can visualize the SPEI of any month on the virtual globe for flexible drought analysis. Meanwhile, the use case also supports cube-based SPEI visualization for a time series drought analysis as given in <<WHU_image7>> (b), where the height of the cube is a range of time arranged in order of month and each layer in the cube represents the drought impact of one month.

==== Case study 2: Drought Risk analysis of Yangtze River basin

In the summer of 2022, an extreme drought hit the Yangtze River basin, posing huge impacts on agriculture, the ecosystem, and human livelihoods. It developed rapidly in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, intensifying on a large scale in 10 provinces (municipalities) in the basin (https://doi.org/10.1002/rvr2.23). The water area of Poyang Lake has been reduced by 90%, threatening the habitat for fish and migratory birds, etc. To analyze drought trends in the Yangtze River Basin, the monthly SPEI for 2022 is shown in <<WHU_image8>>. From the figure, it can be seen that the drought index in the Yangtze River Basin has been rising since March. In July, the drought risk map turned light yellow, indicating a moderate drought. In August and September, the drought further intensified and reached an extreme drought situation. In October, the drought eased somewhat, and it had mostly subsided by November.

==== Case study 3: Drought risk analysis of Poyang Lake

Due to the extreme drought in the Yangtze River Basin, the water inflow into Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, declined dramatically due to continuous hot weather with little rain since early summer. Hence, a use case of drought analysis applying multi-source SR ARD was developed.

In this use case, Sentinel-2 SR and Landsat-8 SR were collected, and Gaofen-1 WFV SR data in the center area of Poyang Lake was produced (As shown in <<WHU_image9>>) before and during the drought period. NDWI indices were calculated to monitor water area changes in Poyang Lake. Water bodies typically exhibit positive NDWI values, making it an effortless method to extract water areas. As illustrated in <<WHU_image10>>, the first column represents Poyang Lake before the drought, while the last three columns represent Poyang Lake which was currently experiencing the drought. It is evident from the RGB composite that the water body of Poyang Lake has significantly decreased due to the drought. The water body extraction results by NDWI indicate that from May to October, the water area in the study area decreased from ~1800 square kilometers to ~350 square kilometers, representing a reduction of ~ 80% in water area.

=== Analysis Ready Data (ARD) Use Case 

==== Background

[quote,Analysis Ready Data (ARD) as defined by CEOS]
Analysis Ready Data (ARD) is remote sensing data and products that have been pre-processed and organized to allow immediate analysis with little additional user effort and interoperability both through time and with other datasets.

Major steps in preparing satellite data into ARD include conversion of
raw readings into radiometric quantity, quality assessment, quantity
normalization, and temporal integration. The ARD should follow the FAIR
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) Data Principles.

Immediate analysis requires that data obtained by the data users exactly
match users' specification in the format, projection, spatial/temporal
coverage and resolution, and parameters so that it can be ingested into
user's analysis system immediately without further efforts. Since
individual data users and projects have different requirements,
personalized services for customizing the data must be provided in order
to meet the requirement of immediate analysis, which we call ARD
services.

Essential Climate Variables (ECV) are key data sets for climate change
studies. https://climatemonitoring.info/ecvinventory/[ECV Inventory]
houses information on Climate Data Records (CDR) provided mostly by CEOS
and CGMS member agencies. The inventory is a structured repository for
the characteristics of two types of GCOS ECV CDRs:

* climate data records that exist and are accessible, including
frequently updated interim CDRs; and
* climate data records that are planned to be delivered.

The ECV Inventory is an open resource to explore existing and planned
data records from space agency sponsored activities and provides a
unique source of information on CDRs available internationally. Access
links to the data are provided within the inventory, alongside details
of the data's provenance, integrity, and application to climate
monitoring.

The client used the existing
https://gis.csiss.gmu.edu/carbon/cwicport/pages/main.html[CEOS WGISS Community Portal]. The portal is capable
of providing automated discovery and customization services of ECV and
satellite data. The client will be able to discover and access ECV and
other remote sensing data and customize them into ARD for anywhere in
the world to support various climate change resilience analysis.

==== Approach

The client instance is implemented as a Web application to support the
creation and delivery of ARD for climate change impact assessment.

The Carbon Portal conducted data discovery and access in the following two steps.

* Step 1: Data collection search
* Step 2: Granule search to search granules in the collection

ARD services are enabled on results of granule search if the collection
is an ECV. If the ECV data provider has implemented the WCS service for
the dataset, the portal will directly communicate with the ECV provider's
WCS server for ARD service. If the ECV data provider does not have the
WCS service, the portal's server will download the entire granule and stage
it on the portal server to provide ARD service.

Most of ECV data provides do not provide such service.

Figure <<software-architecture>> shows a software architecture of the CEOS WGISS Carbon Community Portal.

[[software-architecture]]
.Software Architecture
image::ARD_GMU-architecture.png[software-architecture]

ECV Inventory v4.1 records are converted as a unified form of the portal
predefined metadata format by a converting tool to retrieve collection
metadata for ECV entries from CWIC/FedEO OpenSearch referred by Data
Record Information. There are 1251 ECV inventory records (the same as
WGClimate, 870 for Existing, 381 for Planned). The portal supports
a total of 1910 predefined ECV relative collection datasets from ECV
Records.

ARD service for ECVs in case providers have no WCS services:

* support when the user selects one granule entry;
* download granule dataset file from the given repository and manipulate it
for serving WCS;
* stage the data in the portal backend server and generate a list of all
coverages in the granule;
* the user determines the specifications of data to download; and
* the user obtains the customized data by downloading via WCS GetCoverage
request.

ARD service for ECVs with data providers’ WCS:

* directly talk to provider’s WCS; and
* without granule downloading and stage steps in the portal’s backend
server.

==== Use Case: The climate change impact on crop production in Turkmenistan

This use case is for the climate change impact on crop production in
Turkmenistan. However, the portal can switch to another use case or
support multiple use cases if necessary.

Drought is one of the major climate-related natural hazards that cause
significant crop production loss in Turkmenistan. Climate change
increases the risk of drought in Turkmenistan. Crop models (such as
WOFOST) are often used to support the decision-making in long-term
adaptation and mitigation. The client prepare data to be
readily used as parameters and drivers in such modeling processes.
Drought impact analysis data may include long time series of
precipitation, temperature, or indices for crop conditions, water
content, or evapotranspiration. Many of these climate data and products
from satellite sensors are served at NASA's Goddard Earth Sciences Data
and Information Services Center, such as GPM data products, MERRA
assimilated climate data. These will be used in the case of drought
impact assessment in Turkmenistan.

The drought impact ARD case will demonstrate:

[arabic]
. the applicability of open standards and specifications in support of data
discovery, data integration, data transformation, data processing, data
dissemination, and data visualization;
. transparency of metadata, data quality, and provenance;
. efficiency of using ARD in modeling and analysis; and
. interoperable dissemination of ARD abiding by FAIR principles.

=== Solar climate atlas for Poland

The project aims at creating analysis ready solar radiation data cube and web map services for Poland to advance development of the solar-smart society and economy and to provide know-how and tools which are easily reusable in other geographical regions worldwide, in accordance with the FAIR principles.

[arabic]
The project will update a previously created solar climate atlas for Poland by:

* {blank}
+
increasing spatial and temporal resolution of the datasets: 0.05° x 0.05° degrees (regular lat/lon grid) → 100x100m Monthly means → Daily/Hourly(tbc) means;
* {blank}
+
extending time period: 1991-2014 (24 yrs) → 1983-2022 (40 yrs);
* {blank}
+
replacing static maps with a dynamic and interactive interface;
* {blank}
+
using practical solar radiation parameters instead of physical variables;
* {blank}
+
making datasets (+ metadata) available for downloaded in interoperable file formats (for further use); and
* {blank}
+
providing solar climate knowledge base and data/service user guides 

in order to:

* advance development of the solar-smart society and economy in Poland; and
* provide know-how and tools, which are easily reusable in other geographical regions.

.Solar Climate atlas for Poland available on the IMGW website: https://klimat.imgw.pl/en/solar-atlas
image::Jakub-SolarConditionAtlas.png[]

Newly created *solar climate data cube and web map services* will be more *FAIR* as they will be made available online, possibly on the official website of the Polish Hydrometeorological Service (IMGW) for an increased findability, upon future agreement (to be discussed) to make them more *Findable* by the general public. The whole process of data access (including authentication) will be transparent and accompanied by appropriate instructions so that the *Accessibility* could be much higher. The format of the datasets in the data cube will be an OGC netCDF standard compliant with the CF (Climate and Forecast) convention, which is suitable for encoding a gridded data for space/time-varying phenomena and commonly known in the climate science community but also easily readable with other common spatial data processing and visualization software including most of the GIS software to keep fully *Interoperable*. Finally, even though the proposed solar climate information system (maps+ dataset) are limited to the area of Poland, all processing scripts will be made available on github along with well-described processing steps (both Jupyter notebooks and instructional videos will be considered) to provide *Reusability* for other countries or geographical regions.

It is important to emphasize the importance of solar radiation studies in addressing the impact of climate change. Solar activity is not responsible for the global warming trend we have been experiencing in recent decades. The Sun is, however,a primary energy source driving most of the processes in the Earth's climate system. This energy can also be used as a renewable source of electrical energy. Therefore, knowledge about the spatio-temporal distribution of surface incoming solar radiation is crucial for decision making in the sustainable energy transition process which allow both to rationalize energy consumption and reduce emissions of greenhouse gas (responsible for global warming effects).

*Scope of work for the Climate Resilience Pilot:*
State-of-the-art review and exploratory data analysis

*Objectives for the Climate Resilinece Pilot #1 are:*

* to document existing solar radiation datasets (satellite, model, and reanalysis data) and services (both freely accessible and commercial); and
* to verify the accuracy of the in situ measurements and satellite climate data records for the selected solar radiation parameters using proper statistical methods

Different solar radiation climate data records and their characteristics have been listed in the table below.

All the solar radiation datasets listed above cover the area of Poland but are not ready for direct use by non-scientific users. They are pre-processed to meet the requirements for climate data records and quality controlled but still primarily addressed for further scientific use or not available for free (SOLARGIS). Even though open source tools for managing and exploiting these datasets are often delivered by the data providers, they are not always sufficiently "attractive" due to an extensive workload, which is still required in order to make them easily integrated with additional data from other sources and ready for specific applications in support of policy- and/or decision-making processes at the national level.

The CM SAF SARAH-3 dataset meets all the requirements for the planned solar climate data cube and web map service in terms of quality of estimates, spatial resolution, and temporal coverage.
Its accuracy is now being verified in more detail against in situ measurements for the selected solar radiation parameters using proper statistical methods.

The following table includes a selection of existing solar climate web map services.

Identified services provide generalised information on spatio-temporal solar radiation patterns (high resolution grids for longer periods not available at all or not for free!). A set of high-resolution analysis-ready data products in user-friendly formats dedicated to specific applications at national level are needed to support decision-making processes.

The identified solar radiation services are currently being analyzed in terms of overall functional scope, usability of the interface, innovative tools, and possible shortcomings. 
The results of this analysis will be verified against a detailed recognition of the potential user needs.

=== Wildfire resilience in insurance

The main focus of IFC's participation to this project is to better understand end-to-end hazard and risk modeling workflows, in turn supporting the climate services required for decision-making in the business. This participation is also intended to further open up Intact Lab to the outside world, by exchanging information on wildfire risks and climate resiliency in the context of the insurance industry.

The project centered the efforts around these challenges:

* identify current usages of wildfire maps at Intact by interviewing various business units;

* revisit and update previous wildfire hazard maps, using external open data sources;

* identify and seek collaboration opportunities with pilot participants;

* inform internal architectural, infrastructure, and procurement processes of new geospatial standards and trends; and

* identify and develop insurance wildfires risk use cases to help build resilient communities.

These activities should align with the best practices and standards of the OGC and current and proposed themes in OGC’s climate resilience Domain Working Group (DWG).

Wildfire risk in Canada is prominent and even though major events do not occur every year, they can cause unprecedented damage. Costs from the wildfire events of the summer of 2021 in British Columbia reached $77 and $78 millions in insured damage at White Rock Lake and Lytton, respectively (https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-12-3519-2012). Wildfire activity is expected to go up due to an increase in fire-prone conditions across the country (https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-6329-2017).

In an insurance company, wildfire risk impacts the work of a wide array of users, such as claim adjusters, insurance brokers, engineers, data scientists, actuaries, portfolio managers, and executives. IFC’s stakeholders were invited to provide information about current and potential uses of wildfire risk products within their operations. This information was used to identify use cases supporting this pilot project, as well as prospective proof-of-concepts for wildfire resiliency. It was determined that wildfires can impact numerous activities in the business, including but not limited to, restoration, claims, portfolio management, CAT modeling, risk management, and loss prevention. A resiliency and adaptation use case relevant to the topic of climate resilience is presented below.

Through granting programs, Intact is investing in communities across Canada to protect people from the effects of climate change and build more resilient communities (ESIP: Attribute Convention for Data Discovery (ACDD) – http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/). The Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo and the community of Lac La Biche are both at an increased risk of being affected by wildfires. Their respective programs provide rebates and other incentives to residents to participate in home FireSmart assessments, and to upgrade their homes.

Homeowners are informed of building material options in the immediate zone to reduce their risk of serious property damage. Residents and communities are also presented with landscaping practices for intermediate zones, further helping reduce the risk of wildfires in the area. The Acadia First Nation’s member communities are acting in the extended zone, creating 10 to 30 meter fire breaks to increase time for emergency response in case of fire and to decrease the risk of fire spread.

Ignition zones can be seen as interfaces between individual homes or structures and the surrounding area. In the scientific literature, the area where wildland meets or mixes with human-built structures is called the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI). As the WUI is the area that is the most at risk of wildfire, it is important to closely consider it when modeling risk. The first WUI dataset for Canada was generated in 2018, and it was identified that 3.8% of the national land area is located in the WUI (https://doi.org/10.5220/0006681102050210).

A more comprehensive view of the WUI considers industrial areas as well public infrastructures, such as power lines and railroads. This area is called the Wildland-Human Interface (WHI) and covers 13.0% of the national land. It is estimated that within the WHI, 19.4% of the area is in the zone of wildfire recurrence ≤ 250 years (OGC: OGC 11-165r2: CF-netCDF3 Data Model Extension standard, 2012). By the end of the century, this number could increase to 28.8% under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 low emissions scenario, and to 43.3% under RCP 8.5 high emissions scenario. Integrating WUI in climate scenarios can help in conducting portfolio stress testing and evaluation of future risk.

As cities will keep sprawling as population increases, the WUI is also expected to grow. This is an issue since increased fire activity due to climate change is to be expected. Furthermore, this increased exposure will reach more vulnerable communities. It was shown that WUI is significantly related to socioeconomic variables such as GDP per capita, population density, road density, and the proportion of the population above 65 years old (https://docs.ogc.org/is/14-083r2/14-083r2.html).

The Canadian WUI dataset (https://doi.org/10.5220/0006681102050210) is unfortunately not available for download but could be replicated with open data sources, for instance through Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN) spatial infrastructures. When developing a WUI dataset, an important parameter for users to fine tune is the ember transport distance. Values can vary between the median value of maximum travel distances, which is 600 m (https://doi.org/10.3390/fire3020010), and the maximum travel distance of 2400 m which is the official standard in the United States. Novel wildfire risk models can also dynamically adapt fuel classes within the WUI to represent propagation more accurately. Producing, hosting and integrating WUI datasets can therefore support creation of better risk indices and also help identify vulnerable areas to support further adaptation.
