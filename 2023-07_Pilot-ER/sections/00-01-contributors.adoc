==== About Intact

Intact Financial Corporation (IFC) is the largest provider of Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance in Canada. Its purpose is to help people, businesses and society prosper in good times and be resilient in bad times footnote:[Intact Annual Report 2022, Intact Annual Reports page]. The company has been on the front lines of climate change with our customers for more than a decade – getting them back on track and helping them adapt. As extreme weather is going to get worse over the next decade, Intact intends to double down on adapting to this changing environment and be better prepared for floods, wildfire and extreme heat footnote:[Intact Social Impact & ESG Report 2022, Intact Annual Reports page].

With close to 500 experts in data, artificial intelligence, machine learning and pricing, the Intact Data Lab has deployed almost 300 AI models in production to-date. It is focused on improving risk selection and making operations as efficient as possible while creating outstanding interactions with customers. Within Intact’s Data Lab, the Centre for Climate and Geospatial Analytics (CCGA) uses weather, climate, and geospatial data along with machine learning models and claims data to develop risk maps and other specialized products to the business.


==== About Laubwerk

Laubwerk is a software development company whose mission is to combine accurate, broadly applicable visualizations of vegetation with deeper information and utility that goes far beyond their visual appearance. We achieve this through building a database that combines ultra-realisting 3D representation of plants with extensive metadata that represents plant properties. This unique combination makes Laubwerk a prime partner to bridge the gap from data-driven simulation to eye-catching visualizations.

==== About Pixalytics Ltd

Pixalytics Ltd is an independent consultancy company specializing in Earth Observation (EO). We combine cutting-edge scientific knowledge with satellite and airborne data to provide answers to questions about our planet's resources and behavior. The underlying work includes developing algorithms and software, with activities including a focus on EO quality control and end-user focused applications.

==== About Pelagis

Pelagis is an OceanTech venture located in Nova Scotia, Canada. Our foundation focuses on the application of open geospatial technology and standards designed to promote the sustainable use of our ocean resources. As a member of the Open Geospatial Consortium, we co-chair the Marine Domain Working Group responsible for developing a spatially-aware federated service model of marine and coastal ecosystems.

==== About RSS-Hydro

RSS-Hydro is a geospatial solutions and service company focusing its R&D and commercial products in the area of water risks, with a particular emphasis on the SDGs. RSS-Hydro has been part of several successful OGC testbeds, including the DP 21 to which this pilot is linked, not only in terms of ARD and IRD but also in terms of use cases. In this pilot, RSS-Hydro’s main contribution is the lead of the Engineering report. In terms of technical contributions to various other OGC testbeds and pilots, RSS-Hydro is creating digestible OGC data types and formats for specific partner use cases, in particular producing ARD from publically available EO and model data, including hydrological model output as well as climate projections. These ARD will feed into all use cases for all participants, especially use cases proposed for Floods, Heat, Drought and Health Impacts by other participants in the pilot. The created ARD in various OGC interoperable formats will create digestible dataflows for the proposed OGC Use Cases.

Specifically, RSS-Hydro can provide access to the following satellite and climate projection data:

- Wildfire: Fire Radiant Power (FRP) product from Sentinel 3 (NetCDF), 5p, MODIS products (fire detection), VIIRS (NOAA); possibly biomass availability (fire fuel). 
- Land Surface Temp: Sentinel 3 
- Pollution: Sentinel 5p 
- Climate Projection data (NetCDF, etc., daily downscaled possible): air temp (10 m above ground). Rainfall and possibly wind direction as well
- Satellite-derived Discharge Data to look at Droughts/Floods etc. by basin or other scale.
- Hydrological model simulation outputs at (sub)basin scale.


==== About Safe Software

Safe Software is a leader in supporting geospatial interoperability and automation for more than 25 years as creators of the FME platform. FME was created to promote FAIR principles, including data sharing across barriers and silos, with unparalleled support for a wide array of both vendor specific formats and open standards. Within this platform, Safe Software provides a range of tools to support interoperability workflows. FME Form is a graphical authoring environment that allows users to rapidly prototype transformation workflows in a no-code environment. FME Flow then allows users to publish data transforms to enterprise oriented service architectures. FME Hosted offers a low cost, easy to deploy and scalable environment for deploying transformation and integration services to the cloud.

Open standards have always been a core strategy for Safe Software to better support data sharing. The FME platform can be seen as a bridge between the many supported vendor protocols and open standards such as XML, JSON and OGC standards such as GML, KML, WMS, WFS and OGC APIs.  Safe has collaborated extensively over the years with the open standards community. Safe actively participates in the CityGML and INSPIRE communities in Europe. We are also active within the OGC community and participated in many initiatives including test beds, pilots such as Maritime Limits and Boundaries and IndoorGML, and most recently the 2021 Disaster Pilot and 2023 Climate Resilience Pilot. Safe also actively participates in a number of Domain and Standards working groups.

Walawender is a freelance climate scientist and EO/GIS expert who carries out his PhD research on solar radiation climatology of his home country of Poland at the Laboratory for Climatology and Remote Sensing (LCRS), Faculty of Geography, Philipps University in Marburg, Germany. Jakub specialises in the application of satellite remote sensing, GIS and geostatistics in the monitoring and analysis of climate variability and extremes. He also supports users in the application of different climate data records to tackle the effects of climate change.


==== About Wuhan University (WHU)

Wuhan University (WHU) is a university that plays a significant role in researching and teaching all aspects of surveying and mapping, remote sensing, photogrammetry, and geospatial information sciences in China.
