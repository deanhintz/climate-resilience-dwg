== ARD to Decision Ready Indicator (DRI) [[Chapter_DRI]]

A decision Ready Indicator (DRI) is information and knowledge that provides specific support for actions and decisions. These indicators are pre-determined, using a set recipe which pulls together one or more ARDs to create an indicator of action and/or decision. DRIs hold significant importance as they serve as benchmarks to determine when a decision-making process is adequately prepared and can proceed efficiently. Their importance lies in several aspects. Firstly, DRIs facilitate efficient decision-making by signaling that all necessary information, analysis, and resources are available, minimizing delays and preventing hasty or uninformed decisions. Secondly, they provide quality assurance by setting standards for the decision-making process, ensuring thorough consideration of relevant factors, accurate analysis, and reliable information. DRIs also promote accountability and transparency by defining expectations and providing a framework for evaluation, enabling stakeholders to understand the reasoning behind decisions and hold decision-makers accountable. Additionally, DRIs aid in effective resource allocation by identifying the point at which resources can be allocated, preventing wastage on under prepared decisions. They also assist in managing risks associated with decision-making by encouraging thorough analysis and consideration of potential risks. Furthermore, DRIs promote consistency and standardization, reducing subjectivity and increasing fairness across different decisions. In summary, DRIs play a crucial role in ensuring well-prepared, informed, and accountable decision-making processes, enhancing efficiency, quality, transparency, and resource management.

Analyze Ready Data (ARD) that have been processed to a minimum set of requirements and organized into a form that allows immediate analysis with a minimum of additional user effort and interoperability both through time and with other datasets, form the building blocks for DRIs. The transition from ARDs to DRIs encompasses a series of steps designed to extract meaningful insights and facilitate informed decision-making commencing with the collection and preparation of data, where relevant information is gathered from diverse sources and formatted appropriately for analysis. This involves data cleaning, standardization, and transformation to ensure consistency and reliability. Following data preparation, the integration stage merges multiple data sources, which are aligned based on common variables or identifiers, thereby creating a comprehensive dataset.

Subsequently, data exploration and analysis techniques are employed to delve into the dataset's intricacies. Through statistical analysis, data visualization, and data mining, analysts uncover patterns, relationships, and trends that enable a deeper understanding of the underlying information. Feature engineering plays a crucial role in enhancing the analytical model's performance. By selecting pertinent features, transforming existing variables, handling missing data, and encoding categorical variables, analysts optimize the model's ability to extract insights from the data.

Once the data is prepared and features are engineered, model development ensues. Depending on the nature of the problem and the data at hand, analysts choose appropriate algorithms, such as regression, classification, clustering, or machine learning, to build predictive or analytical models. These models are then trained using a portion of the data, often referred to as the training set. Validation is performed using a separate portion of the data, the validation set, to assess the model's performance. The model can then be fine-tuned for optimal results.

With the validated model in place, the focus shifts to generating DRIs. These indicators are specific metrics, scores, or predictions derived from the model's outputs, providing actionable insights relevant to the decision-making process. The DRIs serve as valuable tools that support decision-makers in interpreting the analyzed data and, therefore, making well-informed choices.

The generated DRIs become pivotal components in the decision-making process. Decision-makers leverage these indicators to assess different scenarios, evaluate risks, and identify opportunities. By incorporating the insights gained from the analyzed data and model outputs, decision-makers can make more informed and data-driven decisions to achieve desired outcomes.

It is worth noting that while the outlined steps provide a general framework, the specific implementation of the process may vary based on the unique context, data characteristics, and analytical techniques employed. Nonetheless, the overarching objective remains constant: to transform Analyze Ready Data into Decision Ready Indicators that facilitate effective decision-making. Below we provide examples on what DRIs can be developed in relation to Climate Resilience.

=== Wildfire hazard component

To develop its component, Intact migrated its previous proprietary wildfire hazard model to a private on-premise data science environment. For key inputs to the model, external connections to several open data repositories were established. To facilitate these access tests, several public open source datasets, such as climate model outputs, Earth observations, weather, and geospatial, were vetted by the appropriate cybersecurity boards. The tests also informed experts of changes in platforms offerings, of new data products specifications, applicable licenses, and of current authoritative scientific references.

|====================

Below is a summarized list of the key datasets required to produce or update a wildfire hazard map.

* National fire database polygon data

* Fire Weather Index (FWI) daily maps

* Land cover maps

* Drought conditions

* Digital Elevation Model (DEM)

* Population density

* Fuel and vegetation data

Intact’s wildfire hazard map is developed exclusively for internal use. Aside from intellectual property terms, it is meant to be deployed in highly secured data environments, and as such it cannot readily interact with other components of the pilot at this point of time. The intent is to develop geospatial infrastructures and legal terms that would allow a closer collaboration with the pilot’s participants.

Very early in the project, Intact also developed an H3 synthetic exposure dataset (see next figure) composed of fourteen million points spread out across the country in a statically representative pattern. The purpose of this dataset was to facilitate visualization and analysis of the exposure and allow pilot participants to have a common exposure reference on which to develop decision-ready use cases for insurance, thus advancing towards standardization. Unfortunately, time constraints prevented update and sharing of this dataset.

// === Pelagis

=== The Blue Economy

Pelagis' participation in the Climate Resilience pilot focuses on enhancing the view of a global oceans observation system by combining real-world ground observations with analysis ready datasets. Monitoring aspects of the oceans through both a temporal and spatial continuum while providing traceability through the observations process allows stakeholders to better understand the stressors affecting ocean health and investigate opportunities to mitigate the longer term implications related to climate change.

The approach to address the needs for a sustainable ocean economy is to make Marine Spatial Planning a core foundation on which to build vertical applications. Pelagis' platform is based on a federated information model represented as a unified social graph. This provides a decentralized approach towards designing various data streams each represented by their well-known and/or standardized model. To date, service layers based on the OGC standards for Feature, Observations, and Measurements, and Sensors APIs have been developed and extended for adoption within the marine domain model. Previous work provides for data discovery and processing of features based on the IHO S-100 standard (Marine Protected Areas, Marine Traffic Management, etc.); NOAA open data pipelines for major weather events (Hurricane Tracking, Ocean Drifters, Saildrones, etc.); as well as connected observation systems as provided by IOOS and its Canadian variant, CIOOS.


==== From Raw Data to ARD and DRIs

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is supported through a number of organizations providing key observation data related to climate change. Of primary interest to this project scenario is the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), and the Joint Working Group on Climate (WG Climate) of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). In-situ data sources are provided through a number of program initiatives sponsored through NOAA and provide key indicators for climate change that cannot be directly inferred from raw satellite information.

GCOS defines 54 Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) of which 18 ECVs apply to the oceans domain. Of these, only 6 ECVs may be inferred from satellite based earth observations while the remainder must be inferred through in-situ site observations and/or sampling programs.

The following table identifies the ocean-specific ECVs and associated providers.

==== Approach

Each ECV applicable to the use case is resolved as a service endpoint representing the area of interest, associated samplings, and observations, and where possible, inferred from earth observation datasets transformed as 'analysis ready.'
Earth observation datasets are sourced through the ESA GCOS service endpoint; ocean related samplings and in-situ observations are sourced through NOAA; socio-economic data is sourced from various open data portals available through government agencies.

The project effort centers around 3 key challenges:

* the ability to collect data relevant to Climate Resilience;
* the ability to apply the data in a coherent and standardized manner in which to draw out context; and
* the ability to impart insight to community members and stakeholders so as to identify, anticipate, and mitigate the effects of climate change across both local and international boundaries.

Each of these activities aligns with the best practices and standards of OGC and are used as input to the MarineDWG MSDI reference model.

=== DRI: Heat Impact and Drought Impact FME Components

The following subsections cover the heat and drought impact components developed by Safe Software using the FME platform. For more information on the ARD component these depend on see the 4.3 section on Data Cube to ARD with FME.

==== Heat Impact DRI Component

This component takes the climate scenario summary ARD results from the ARD component and analyzes them to derive estimated heat impacts over time, based on selected climate scenarios. Central to this is the identification of key heat impact indicators required by decision makers and the business rules needed to drive them. Process steps include data aggregation and statistical analysis of maximum temperature spikes, taking into account the cumulative impacts of multiple high temperature days. Heat exhaustion effects are likely dependent on duration of heat spells, in addition to high maximum temperatures on certain days.

==== Drought Impact DRI Component and Interoperability with Other Components

This component takes the climate scenario summary ARD results from the ARD component and analyzes them to derive estimated drought risk impacts over time based on selected climate scenarios. It also feeds drought related environmental factors to other pilot DRI components for more refined drought risk analysis. For the purposes of this pilot, it was recognized that more complex indicators such as drought are likely driven by multiple environmental and physical factors. As such, our initial goal was to select and provide primary climate variable data that would be useful for deriving drought risks in combination with other inputs. Given that the primary input to drought models is precipitation, or lack thereof, we developed a data flow that extracted total precipitation per month and made this available both as a time series CSV and GeoJSON datasets, as well as OGC API features time series points. This climate scenario primary drought data was provided for the province of Manitoba and for Los Angeles. These two regions were chosen since there were pilot participants interested in each of these regions and, in the case of Manitoba, there is also a tie in to future work as this is an area of interest for the subsequent Disaster Pilot 2023.

The Los Angeles use case provided the Laubwerk visualization component with climate change impact data that could help drive a drought impact that could affect their future landscape visualization model. The idea is that based on changes to climatic variables, certain areas may be more or less suited to different vegetation types, causing the distribution of vegetation to change over time. For more on their component, including example visualization results, please refer to section 7: From Data To Visualization.

In the case of this visualization component, simply providing precipitation totals per month were not sufficient to drive the needs of their vegetation model. In this case there was not an intermediate drought model to feed climate variables to. In the absence of a more comprehensive drought model, the decision was made to develop a proxy drought risk indicator by normalizing the difference between precipitation from the past versus future climate scenarios.

Calculations were made using the difference between time series grids of projected precipitation and historical grids of mean precipitation per month. These precipitation deltas were then divided by the historical mean per month to derive a precipitation index. The goal was to provide a value between 0 and 1 where 1 = 100% of past mean precipitation for that month. Naturally this approach can generate values that exceed the range of 1 if the projected precipitation values exceed the historic mean. The goal was not so much to predict future absolute precipitation values but rather to generate an estimated for precipitation trends given the influence of climate change. For example, this approach can help answer the question - in 30 years for a given location, compare to historical norms, by what percentage do we expect precipitation to increase or decrease. Laubwerk then used these results as input to Laubwerk's landscape vegetation model which evaluates precipitation changes to determine whether the drought stress will cause a specific vegetation species to die out for a particular location.

Interesting patterns emerged for the LA area when this process was run on deltas between projected and historical precipitation. Summers are typically dry while winters are wet and prone to flash floods. Initial data exploration seemed to show an increase in drought patterns in the spring and fall. More analysis needs to be done to see if this is a general pattern or simply one that emerged from the climate scenario that was run. However, this is the type of trend that local planners and managers may benefit from having the ability to explore once better access to climate model scenario outputs is achieved along with the ability to query and analyze the results.

This approach is only a start and just scratches the surface in terms of what is possible for future drought projection based on climate model scenario climate variables. The specific business rules used to assess drought risk could be enriched and refined, or climate variables can simply be fed to external drought models as described below. FME provides a flexible data and business rule modeling framework. This means that as indicators and drought threshold rules are refined, it is relatively straightforward to adjust the business rules in this component to refine risk projections. Also, business rule parameters can be externalized as execution parameters so that end users can control key aspects of the scenario drought risk assessment without having to modify the published FME workflow. However one of the main goals of this pilot was not so much to produced highly refined forecast models for drought but rather to demonstrate the data value chain whereby raw climate model data cube outputs can feed a data pipeline that filters, refines, and simplifies the data and ultimately can be used to drive indicators that help planners model visualize and understand the effects of climate change on the landscapes and environments within their communities.

To support future drought risk estimates for Manitoba, precipitation forecast time series were provided to Pixalytics as an input to their drought analytics and DRI component. Their component provides a much more sophisticated indicator of drought probability since, in addition to precipitation, it also takes into account soil moisture and vegetation. The goal was to extract precipitation totals per time step from the downscaled regional climate model (RCM) climate variable outputs for Manitoba based on CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) model results obtained from Environment Canada. For this use case the grids have a spatial resolution of roughly 10 km and a temporal resolution of a monthly time step. The Pixalytics drought model was then run based on these precipitation estimates in order to asses potential future drought risk in southern Manitoba. The data was provided to Pixalytics initially as a GeoJSON feed of 2d points derived from the data cube cells with precipitation totals per cell. This same data feed was later provided as a OGC API Feature service.

For future phases of the climate or disaster pilots, it may be useful to explore additional approaches for both precipitation data analysis and combination with other related datasets and external models. It may be useful to segment cumulative rainfall below a certain threshold within a certain time window (days, weeks, or months), since cumulative rainfall over time will be crucial for computing water budgets by watershed or catch basin. To do this, the use of higher resolution time steps (daily) should be tested, to see if the increased resolution reveals patterns that the coarser monthly time step does not. There are also other statistical RCM results that might be useful to make available (mean, min, max). In addition to precipitation, climate models also generate soil moisture predictions which could used to assess drought risk. This component would also benefit from integration with topography, DEMs, and hydrology related data such as river networks, water bodies, aquifers, and watershed boundaries. This would help increase the effective spatial resolution of impact projections by combining the coarser climate projections with higher resolution local factors such as elevation. Therefore, rather than just computing precipitation deltas at the cell level, soil moisture predictions would allow for assessing flood risks along rivers and water bodies and provide the ability to evaluate precipitation by catch basin and compute future cumulative trends that may indicate potential drought or flood, or derivative impacts such as irrigation or hydropower generation potential.

It should be stressed that the field of drought modeling is not new and there are many drought modeling tools available that are far more sophisticated than anything described above. As such, subsequent Climate and Disaster pilots should explore how future climate projections can be funneled into these more mature climate and impact models in an automated fashion to produce more refined estimates of projected drought risk. That said, it is hoped that this basic demonstration of the raw data to ARD to DRI value chain for drought can provide some insights into what type of indicators should be generated to help better understand future drought risks, and where improvements on this process can be made.
