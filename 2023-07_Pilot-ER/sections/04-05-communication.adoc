== Climate Information and Communication with Stakeholders [[Chapter_Communication]]

Climate change is happening, and mitigation efforts will simply not be enough  to tackle its impacts. Thus, climate action, mitigation as well as adaptation, at the local level is needed. The alpS GmbH supports communities, regions, and industrial partners in their sustainable development and in dealing with the consequences, opportunities, and risks of climate change.

In the understanding of alpS, climate change consultancy services are successful, if they trigger the implementation of proactive measures to enhance climate resilience that are supported by a large part of actors. However, the degree of effectiveness of the consultancy services of alpS as a function of various communication methods (e. g. presentations including processed local climate data, information processing, moderation techniques, discussion tools) and scientific know-how has never been systematically investigated. In the pilot project, alpS therefore evaluated its inventory of methods used in its climate change adaptation workshops and started with the improvement of the workshop setup and aspects of communication.

In addition, during this Climate Resilience Pilot, the importance of stakeholder participation became apparent. At the final workshop in Huntsville, all participants agreed that there needs to be more focus on stakeholder engagement and that questions should come from the stakeholders rather than being predefined by the availability of data. This would put communication with stakeholders at the centre of the upcoming phases of the project.

=== Climate adaptation processes
One way to introduce adaptation processes is to frame them as a cycle (Figure 1). It starts with the evaluation of past, present, and future climatic conditions to define the exposure of a system to the impacts of climate change. Assessing the sensitivity of a system towards the impacts of climate change with local experts based on the exposure forms the second step. Thus, the risk of a system results from its exposure and sensitivity, based on which targeted adaptation measures can be implemented. Finally, the fifth stage is monitoring and evaluation. At this point the cycle starts over again.

In the entire  program, the focus is on supporting the communities to secure the living and economic space at the local level, which requires a well-founded assessment of the climate risks supported by local experts. The aim is to minimize risks, take necessary measures and raise awareness of precautionary planning, especially regarding the consequences of climate change.

The conducted evaluation focuses on one participatory element of adaptation cycles, the impact analysis workshops. The workshops aim to initiate stakeholder participation, raise local awareness of climate change impacts, gather expert input on sensitivity and implement an adaptation process that is widely accepted. 

=== Approach

alpS conducted a structured evaluation of available datasets of participatory processes with the aim to improve the level of information about climate change impacts and to identify the broadest accepted way of presenting user-related scientific statements. The assessment of adaptation cycles at different spatial levels allowed the further development and improvement of suitable interoperable solutions.

A set of questions was developed to measure the success of vulnerability workshops.  This involved developing questions on workshop content (e.g., climate information, methodological approach) and permanence (e.g., adaptation measures implemented), in addition to external factors that influence workshop outcomes (e.g., political backing, human resources, time spent, financial commitment to adaptation, geographic conditions). 

In a three-stage process, workshop participants were surveyed before the workshop, immediately after the workshop, and six months after the workshop. The following figure provides an overview of the survey process (Figure 2). In total, six representatives of communities or regions were asked for a pilot survey. Stakeholders of three of the communities and regions were interviewed shortly before the workshop, one community was interviewed immediately after a workshop implementation and two communities and regions were interviewed more than six months after their workshop participation. To supplement the comparatively small pilot survey, experiences from previous consulting cycles are also considered in the following.

=== Main results of interviews

In all surveyed municipalities or regions, it could be shown that the assessment of climate impacts must be done on the local level. Regional adaptation strategies and climate information provide a good overview and starting point for the municipal level. In topographically heterogeneous areas, such as mountainous areas, there is a need for assessments at the local level. It is therefore necessary to reassess climate impacts from a community perspective, considering the local risk landscape. A detailed consideration of the risks and the subsequent intersection of risks with the consequences of climate change is suitable to promote awareness, clarify the community's concern, and facilitate the implementation of measures due to safety aspects. For this, climate information must be prepared accordingly. Climate data must not be too complicated but should not leave anything out. Especially climate impacts for which the community's sensitivity is assessed in the vulnerability workshop by local actors must be  accurate, consistent, and not duplicative. To achieve this, the climate impact chain will be introduced in the next section.

The abundance of content when initiating adaptation measures often leads to the community being overwelmed. The limitation to selected climate impacts is achieved through the identification of adaptation needs. This leads to the necessary focus on a few but urgent adaptation measures. The elaboration of measures must be done individually and in consideration of the communities' ideas. Showing good examples of adaptation is useful and provides inspiration, however, in surveyed communities and regions mostly new measures were developed, which are exactly tailored to local conditions and needs. Necessary measures can partly be implemented directly by the municipality or only in cooperation with other actors (landowners, other municipalities, etc.). Both the development of measures and the process support must be carried out against this background.

Supporting communities throughout the process is essential. Equally important is the cooperation between local organizations and, scientifically sound external support that conveys seriousness and builds stakeholder's confidence in the adaptation process. In addition, an active contact person with sufficient time resources is needed in each community to bring together the relevant actors and to follow up the topic beyond the events. Only in this way successful adaptation can take place.


=== Improvement of the workshop setup and aspects of communication

As part of the Climate Resilience Pilot, alpS was able to optimize two aspects in the adaptation process. First, the creation of climate impact chains for different sectors was initiated. The climate impact chain improves consistency and the understanding of climate impacts. Second, the guideline to deal with external factors was developed. The pre-test conducted before the workshop, which specifically asks about these external factors, enables a direct response and preparation for dealing with not controllable factors in the process.


==== Climate Impact Chain

In the current workshop design of the vulnerability workshops of alpS, local climate impacts are assessed on a matrix. The responses from workshop participants highlighted the importance of clear, unambiguous, and simple language when communicating climate impacts. Inspired by the responses of the workshop participants, the wording of climate impacts was optimized and broken down in the context of an impact chain from climatic effect  to direct and indirect climate impacts (Figure 3). Thus, it is easy to understand which climatic effects drive climate impacts. This facilitates the data-driven assessment of the exposure of individual communities. In addition to the exemplary impact chain for the forestry sector shown in figure 3, further impact chains were created for all relevant fields of action in climate adaptation.

==== Uncontrolled external influences

Conducting a vulnerability assessment workshop as part of the adaptation process is a complex sub-process. Its success depends on many factors, some of which are controlled by the moderator, but others are not. The latter are here called “external factors” and encompass influences and motivations of individual participants. The identification of the relevant external factors is important because if the existence and markedness of external factors for a particular workshop is known, adequate predefined responses can be implemented to better control the sub-process.

Indeed, the question of what motivates climate change adaptation behavior is widely discussed in literature. In a meta-analysis over 106 studies van Valkengoed, A., & Steg, L. (2019) investigate the relationship between adaptation behavior of households and 13 motivational factors. These factors are included in various theoretical frameworks but are rather generalized and not concrete enough to be taken into account here. In fact, anything that influences the workshop participants can have an impact on the workshop outcome and could therefore be called a factor. However, in order to keep the application of the guideline practicable, the catalog of external factors is limited to the key factors, which in addition should also be easy to research and observe. 

The evaluation of the existence and markedness of external factors on the basis of the compiled catalog needs to be performed from the participants’ perspective: How strongly do they perceive (consciously or subconsciously) an external influence. And does this external influence meet with an optimistic or pessimistic basic attitude? Are the participants rather jaded or thin-skinned?

We have learned that it is a good possibility to gather information about the background and motivation of individual participants in preparatory talks with the organizer.

Catalog of external factors:

. Natural space the municipality / company is located in
. Number of inhabitants / number of employees
. Vulnerabilities are known that are affected by climate change
.. strong dependence on a few infrastructures
.. strong dependence on a few companies / sectors of the economy
.. demographic characteristics
.. shortages in emergency responses
. The municipality / company depends on its neighbors to carry out its adaptation measures (e.g. upstream/downstream riparian community set of problems).
. In case of a suffered catastrophe (here or elsewhere): Have neglected precautions  led to legal or political consequences ?
. The municipality / company has experience with weather extremes or unusual seasonal conditions.
. The municipality / company is affected by other geophysical, geopolitical, social or economic crises.
. The handling of climate change in the media is present.
. Political backing is given.
. Provided human resources are sufficient.
. Monetary commitment for climate adaptation is sufficient.
. Participants are legally obligated to take precautions.
. Risks of increased devaluation of real estate, equity investments, property, plant and equipment as well as increased depreciation, interest and insurance costs exist.
. Participants recognize different needs, advantages and benefits.
. Individuals are willing to take responsibility.
. Different perception of the environment: outdoor professionals (e.g. farmers, foresters) as well as indoor professionals are participating.
. Different levels of knowledge: accepted experts for individual topics (e.g. infrastructure, public health) are participating.


=== Outlook: Stakeholders as a starting point for processing climate information

Overall, the consensus at the Closing Workshop in Huntsville was to focus more on stakeholder participation and to start from the stakeholders' questions instead of the raw data. alpS is experienced in implementing and guiding participatory processes. In the coming project phase, alpS could offer a concept that enables data providers to identify their stakeholders, jointly define questions and collect targeted feedback.


=== Summary
