== Executive Summary

The OGC Climate Resilience Pilot marked the beginning of a series of enduring climate initiatives with the primary goal of evaluating the value chain encompassing raw data to climate information processes within Climate Resilience Information Systems. This includes the transformation of geospatial data, into meaningful knowledge for various stakeholders, including decision-makers, scientists, policymakers, data providers, software developers, service providers, and emergency managers. The results of the OGC Climate Resilience Pilot are supporting the location community to develop more powerful visualization and communication tools to accurately address ongoing climate threats such as heat, drought, floods, wild-fires as well as supporting governments in meeting commitments for their climate strategies. This will be accomplished through evolving geospatial data, technologies, and other capabilities into valuable information for decision-makers, scientists, policymakers, data providers, software developers, and service providers so they can make valuable, informed decisions to improve climate action.
One of the most significant challenges so far has been converting the outputs of global and regional climate models into specific impacts and risks at the local level. The climate science community has adopted standards, and there are now numerous climate resilience information systems available online, allowing experts to exchange and compare data effectively. However, professionals outside the weather and climate domain, such as planners and GIS analysts working for agencies dealing with climate change impacts, have limited familiarity with and capacity to utilize climate data.

Stakeholders depend on meaningful information to make decisions or advance their science. In the context of climate change, this meaningful information is delivered through climate services, as a combination of technical applications and human consultation. The technical infrastructures underpinning climate services, named here as Climate Resilience Information Systems, require the processing of vast amounts of data from diverse providers across various scientific ecosystems:
 
•	transforming raw data into Data Cubes and 
•	delivering it as Analysis-Ready Data and from there into 
•	Decision Ready Indicators to become more useful for supporting decisions related to climate action. 
•	In a further step, the data for visualization and simulation on demand are shown 
•	communication to stakeholders with good practice guidance on how to perform this communication 

This report assesses the value chain from raw data to climate information and the onward communication to stakeholders. It shows good practices on how to design climate resilience information systems, identifies gaps, and gives recommendations on future work.

The OGC pilot demonstrated the capability of creating data pipelines to convert vast amounts of raw data through various steps into decision-ready information and 3D visualizations while embedding good practice approaches of communicating this knowledge to non-specialized individuals. In other words, in order to obtain decision-ready information, the data must first be collected from multiple sources and organized, for example into Data Cubes, to be transformed into analysis-ready formats. Either as raw data, from Data Cubes, or via analysis-ready formats the data pipeline to decision-ready indicators has been shown. 

To address the value chain from raw data to decision-ready indicators, one focus of this pilot was to explore methods for extracting climate variables from climate model output scenarios and delivering them in formats that are more easily usable for post-processing experts, alongside being applicable to local situations and specific use-cases. Climate variable Data Cubes were extracted or aggregated into temporal and spatial ranges specific to the use cases. Then, the data structure was transformed from multidimensional gridded cubes into forms that can be readily utilized by geospatial applications. These pilot data flows serve as excellent examples of how climate data records can be translated into estimates of impacts and risk at the local level in a way that seamlessly integrates into existing planning workflows and is made available to a broad user community via open standards.

In addition, the pilot explored various parts of the processing pipelines that were examined using climate-impact case studies related to heat, droughts, floods, and wildfires, highlighting assessment tools and the complexities of climate indices. It also recognized the existence of solar radiation databases and web map services, emphasizing the need to enhance their accessibility and applicability at a national level to combat the effects of climate change by utilizing solar energy resources more efficiently. Ultimately, this Climate Resilience Pilot serves as a crucial asset for making well-informed decisions that bolster climate action. It particularly aids the location community in developing enhanced 3D visualization, simulation, and communication tools to effectively address prevalent climate change impacts or hazards caused by meteorological extreme events.

This report also demonstrates the workflow from data to 3D visualization, catering to non-technical individuals. A chapter is dedicated to the options and challenges of applying artificial intelligence to establish a climate scenario digital twin where various scenarios of efficiencies of climate action can be simulated. These simulations can encompass the reduction of disaster risks through technical engineering. The concept of climate resilience is explored, not only considering the shift of meteorological phenomena but also accounting for land degradation and biodiversity loss. More specifically, the scenarios focus on understanding the effects of climate change on vegetation in the Los Angeles area. 3D landscape vegetation simulations are presented, demonstrating how different tree species adapt under changing climate conditions represented by a range of climate and policy scenarios over time.

The pilot acknowledges the significant challenges of effectively conveying information to decision-makers. This necessitates a thorough examination of communication methods. Consequently, a dedicated chapter emphasizes unique approaches to facilitate effective communication with non-technical individuals, who frequently hold responsibility for local climate resilience action strategies. The development and implementation of a stakeholder survey provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses of past adaptation processes and allows for the derivation of opportunities for improvement. By prioritizing communication, the pilot aims to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring accurate and comprehensive information transmission for the benefit of both sides. The addition of this chapter demonstrates the pilot’s aim to enhance communication strategies to foster improved decision-making in the realm of climate resilience.

Overall, this engineering report presents: 
•	various workflow processes, 
•	illustrating the seamless exchange of data, models, and components like climate application packages, 
•	emphasizing the potential for optimization using OGC Standards. 
•	In the context of climate and disaster resilience, this document greatly contributes to a comprehensive comprehension of flood, drought, heat, and wildfire assessments,
•	offering insights into decision-making for climate actions. 
•	Specifically, it addresses the enhancement of Climate Resilience Information Systems in line with FAIR Climate Services principles.
