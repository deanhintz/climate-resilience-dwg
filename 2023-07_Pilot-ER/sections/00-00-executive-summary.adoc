== Executive Summary

Stakeholders depend on meaningful information to make decisions or advance their science. In the context of climate, this meaningful information is delivered through climate services, as a combination of technical applications and human consultation. The technical infrastructures underpinning climate services, so called climate resilience information systems, necessitate the processing of vast amounts of data from diverse providers across various scientific ecosystems: Transforming raw data into Data Cubes and delivering it as analysis-ready data and from there into indicators to become more useful for supporting decisions related to climate action. This report is assessing the value chain from raw data to climate information and their communication to stakeholders. It shows good practices on how to design climate resilience information systems, identifies gaps and gives recommendations on future work. 

The OGC Climate Resilience Pilot marked the beginning of a series of enduring climate initiatives with the primary goal of evaluating the value chain encompassing raw data to climate information processes within climate resilience information systems. This encompasses the transformation of geospatial data, into meaningful knowledge for various stakeholders, including decision-makers, scientists, policymakers, data providers, software developers, service providers and emergency responders. The OGC pilot demonstrated the capability of creating data pipelines to convert vast amounts of raw data through various steps into decision-ready information and 3D visualizations, while embedding good practice approaches of communicating this knowledge to non-specialized individuals. To be more exact, in order to obtain decision-ready information, the data must first be collected from multiple sources and organized into processing pipelines to be transformed into analysis-ready formats. The significance of having analysis-ready data and decision-ready indicators was highlighted during discussions covering various aspects of Data Cubes. This OGC pilot explored various parts of the processing pipelines that transform data into meaningful knowledge by examining climate impacted case studies related to heat, droughts, floods, and wildfires, highlighting assessment tools and the complexities of climate indices. The study also recognized, the existence of solar radiation databases and web map services, emphasizing the need to enhance their accessibility and applicability at a national level to combat the effects of climate change by utilizing solar energy resources more efficiently. Ultimately, this Climate Resilience Pilot serves as a crucial asset for making well-informed decisions that bolster climate action. It particularly aids the location community in developing enhanced 3D visualization, simulation, and communication tools to effectively address prevalent climate change impacts or hazards caused by meteorological extreme events.

One of the most significant challenges so far has been converting the outputs of global climate models into specific impacts and risks at the local level. The climate modeling community has adopted standards, and there are now numerous climate resilience information systems available online, allowing modelers to exchange and compare data effectively. However, professionals outside the weather and climate domain, such as planners and GIS analysts working for agencies dealing with climate change impacts, have limited familiarity with and capacity to utilize climate model results. To address this issue, one focus of this pilot was to explore methods for extracting climate variables from climate model output scenarios and delivering them in formats that are more easily usable post processing experts. applicable to local situations and specific use-cases. 
The relevant climate variables for the specific use case were carefully selected. Climate variable data cubes were extracted into temporal and spatial ranges specific to the use cases. Then, the data structure was transformed from multidimensional gridded cubes into data forms that can be readily utilized by geospatial applications. For example, open standards like OGC GeoPackage and geoJSON point data were employed, and published to OGC API services, making them readily accessible and explorable by a broader user community. These pilot data flows serve as excellent examples of how climate model results can be translated into estimates of impacts and risk at the local level in a way that seamlessly integrates into existing planning workflows.

This report also demonstrates the workflow from data to visualization, catering to non-specialized individuals. A chapter is dedicated to the options and challenges of applying artificial intelligence to establish a 5D meta world where various scenarios of efficiencies of climate action can be simulated. These simulations can encompass the reduction of disaster risks through technical engineering constructions like dams. The concept of climate resilience is explored, not only considering the shift of meteorological phenomena but also accounting for land degradation and biodiversity loss. More specifically, the scenarios focus on understanding the effects of climate change on vegetation in the Los Angeles area. 3D landscape vegetation simulations are presented, demonstrating how different tree species adapt under changing climate conditions represented by a range of climate and policy scenarios over time.

The pilot acknowledges the significant challenges of effectively conveying information to decision-makers, necessitates a thorough examination of communication methods. Consequently, a dedicated chapter has been incorporated into the pilot’s work to address this issue. This chapter emphasizes unique approaches that facilitate effective communication with non-technical individuals, who frequently hold responsibility for local climate resilience action strategies. By prioritizing communication, the pilot aims to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring accurate and comprehensive information transmission. The addition of this chapter demonstrates the pilot’s aim to enhancing communication strategies to foster improved decision-making in the realm of climate resilience.

This engineering report presents various workflow processes, illustrating the seamless exchange of data, models, and components like climate application packages, emphasizing the potential for optimization using OGC Standards. In the context of climate and disaster resilience, this document greatly contributes to a comprehensive comprehension of flood, drought, heat, and wildfire assessments, offering insights into decision-making for climate actions. Specifically, it addresses the enhancement of Climate Resilience Information Systems in line with FAIR Climate Services principles.
